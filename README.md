STM32F4 Generic Template
==============

Why?
--------------

The main goal is to have a generic template for starting projects with the
STM32F4 microcontroller.  This can be copied and modified for each individual
project to save time.

**Other reasons include:**

-I'm not a fan of *The Cube*

-I'm not a fan of *IDE's*
